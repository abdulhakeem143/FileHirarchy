challege: - we have some file names "File1", " File2", "  File3", " File4", "File5" .
suppouse "File1" doesn't have spaces before it is an Parent File
and " File2" having a single space before it so it is an "File1" childe
and "  File3" having two spaces before it's file name  so it is an child of " File2" 
and " File4" having a single space before its file name so it is an "File1" 's child
and "File5" doesn't have any spaces before it so it is an indipendent File.

We have to take input from inputFile.txt
so create a inputFile.txt file
and add this text in it :-

File1 
 File2 
  File3
 File4
File5

so create a java code to find who is the file's parent is  in the given format

Required Output Format :

FileName   ParentFile
========== ==========
File5      null
File4      File1
File3      File2
File2      File1
File1      null
